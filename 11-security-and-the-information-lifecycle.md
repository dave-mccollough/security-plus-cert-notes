# Security and the Information Lifecycle

## Information Lifecycle
- Security should be involved in every phase
- Data collection
    - Consent to collect and use data
    - Storage of data
    - Processing of data
    - Sharing of data
    - Archival and deletion of data

## Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
- One or more pieces of sensitive information that can be traced back to an individual
    - Social Security Numbers
    - Credit Card Numbers
    - Email Addresses
    - Mothers maiden name

## Protected Health Information (PHI)
- One or more pieces of senstitive medical information that can be traced back to an individual
    - Health Insurance plan number
    - Blood type
    - Patient medical ailments

## Privacy Enhancing Technologies
- Anonymization
    - GDPR allows anonymized data to be collected without user consent
    - Anonymized data has limited marketing value

- Anonymization Techniques
    - Pseudo-anonymization 
        - Replace PII with fake identifiers
    - Data Minimization
        - Limit collected, stored/retained sensitive data 
    - Tokenization
        - Digital token that authorizes access or use instead of original credentials or data
    - Data Masking
        - Hide sensitive data from unauthorized users
            - Masking credit card numbers on a receipt
            - Masked passwords
        
## Data Sovereignty
- Where data is physically located and any laws that apply to collection and storage of that data
    - Where did the data orginiate?
    - Where is the data stored?
    - Where is the data being replicated to?
    - What laws/regulations apply to that data
