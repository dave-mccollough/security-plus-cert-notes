# Viruses

- Viruses are malicious code that runs on a machine without the users knowledge and infects the computer when executed.

- Viruses require a user action in order to reproduce and spread

## 10 Different types of viruses

### Boot Sector
- Boot sector viruses are stored in the first sector of a hard drive and are loaded into memory upon boot up

### Macro
- Macro viruses are embedded into a document and is executed when the document is opened by the user
- By default aren't malicious

### Program
- Program viruses infect an executable or application

### Multipartite
- Multipartite viruses combine boot and program viruses to first attach itself to the boot sector and system files before attacking other files on the computer.  Virus loads itself each time the computer boots.  
- Viruses can be encrypted 

### Polymorphic
- Polymorphic viruses are an advanced version of an encrypted virus that changes itself every time it is executed by altering the decryption module to avoid detection.
- Virus morphes the way it's code looks so a signature based antivirus application can't detect it

### Metamorphic
- Metamorphic viruses rewrite themselves entirely before attempting to infect a file
- Advanced version of a polymorphic virus

### Stealth
- Stealth viruses use various techniques to avoid detection by anti-virus software.  Examples of these are:
    - Encrypted Viruses
    - Polymorphic Viruses
    - Metamorphic Viruses

### Armored
- Armored viruses have a layer of protection to confuse a program or person analyzing it.

### Hoax
- Tricking user into infecting their own machine.  May come in the form of a popup message, social engineering, etc.
