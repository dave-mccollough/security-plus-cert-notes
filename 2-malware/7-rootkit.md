# Rootkit

- Rootkits are a type of software designed to gain admin level control over a system without detection.

- Rootkits use DLL injection which allows them to maintain persistent control

- DLL injection is malicious code inserted into a running process on a Windows machine by taking advantage of Dynamic Link Libraries loaded at runtime

- Driver Manipulation is an attack that relies on comprimising the kernal mode device drivers that operate at a priviledge or system level
    - A **shim** is code that is placed between two components to intercept calls and redirect them

- Rootkits are activated before booting the operating system and are difficult to detect

- Boot from external device then scan internal drives
