# Qualitative Risk Assessment

- Based on numeric values
- Based on asset value
- Eposure Factor
    - Percentage of asset value loss when negative incident occurs

## Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)
- How much loss is experienced during one negative incident?

- Multiply asset value (AV) x Exposure Factor(EF)

- Understand how this works for the exam

## Calculate Single Loss Expectancy
- SLE = Asset value (AV) x Exposure Factor(EF)

## Annualized Rate of Occurance (ARO)
- Expected number or yearly occurances

## Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)
- Total yearly cost of bad things happening
- ALE = SLE x ARO
    - Annualized Loss Expectancey = Single Loss Expectancy x Annualized Rate of Occuranc


- Compare ALE against what organization is spending for Security controls
